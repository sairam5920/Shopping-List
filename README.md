#Shopping List 

This Shopping List Manager is a beginner-friendly Java console application that allows users to maintain a simple shopping list using file I/O operations. 
It reads an existing list from a file (data.txt), displays the current items, and allows the user to add a new item via console input. The updated list is
then saved back to the file, ensuring persistent data between runs. The program uses ArrayList for dynamic storage, Scanner for reading both user and file 
input, and PrintWriter for writing to the file. This project showcases basic file handling, user interaction, and list manipulation in Javaâ€”ideal for those
learning how to persist data locally.

ðŸ”¹ main(String[] args)

What it does:

Calls readData() to load the existing shopping list from data.txt.

Displays the current list using printList().
